Welcome to the “Marine Mammals VS Climate change” project!

Our modelling project aims to gather and analyse available data on marine mammals that are fully or partially habitating the Arctic as their habitat during their lifetimes, combine it with atmospheric and oceanographic time series data from the Arctic region, and predict their future distribution under the hypothesis that as a result of global climate change, sea ice is retreating and the average surface ocean temperature is rising. 

Brief description of the dataset:

The dataset used for our species presence analysis called ‘Marine Mammals Sightings in and around Svalbard 1995-2016’ is publicly accessible the website of the Norwegian Polar Institute on the link: 

https://data.npolar.no/dataset/246c1053-6fdc-5043-b7b4-284f4fa8c095 (CSV form). 

The dataset contains 17375 rows × 18 columns | 1995-04-01 to 2016-11-10 | Columns names: 
Date,
Latitude,
Longitude,
Location,

The dataset used for the atmospheric and oceanographic data called ‘Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data’ is publicly accessible and can be found in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data . 

More specifically, we are using the following datasets: 

 ‘GlobalTemperatures.csv’ |  3192 rows × 9 columns | Contains the columns: 
Date,
Land Average Temperature,
Land Average Temperature Uncertainty,
Land Max Temperature,
Land Max Temperature Uncertainty,
Land Min Temperature,
Land Min Temperature Uncertainty,
Land And Ocean Average Temperature,
Land And Ocean Average Temperature Uncertainty 

‘Global Average Land Temperature by Country.csv’ | 577462 rows × 4 columns | Containing the columns: 
Date,
AverageTemperature,
AverageTemperatureUncertainty,
Country


High-level Planning of the project: 

Day 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis, 

Day 2 - Clean the data:
Remove typos,
Correct data types,   
Remove unnecessary column,
Remove/replace null/Nan values 

Day 3 - Transform the data:
Scale Numerical Features,
Encode Categorical Features,
Modelling

Day 4 - Presentation preparation
